# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a devcontainer.json Validator CLI tool that verifies whether devcontainer.json files comply with basic conventions. The tool will provide a simple command-line interface for developers to validate their development container configurations, ensuring they contain required properties and follow established standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate a devcontainer.json file from the command line, so that I can ensure my development container configuration is properly formatted before using it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the command `validate-devcontainer /path/to/devcontainer.json` THEN the system SHALL read and parse the specified devcontainer.json file
2. IF the file path does not exist THEN the system SHALL display an error message indicating the file was not found
3. IF the file is not valid JSON THEN the system SHALL display an error message indicating invalid JSON format
4. WHEN the file is successfully parsed THEN the system SHALL proceed to validation checks

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the validator to check for required properties in my devcontainer.json, so that I can ensure my configuration meets minimum standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating a devcontainer.json file THEN the system SHALL check for the presence of the "name" property
2. WHEN validating a devcontainer.json file THEN the system SHALL check for the presence of the "image" property
3. IF the "name" property is missing THEN the system SHALL record a validation failure for missing name
4. IF the "image" property is missing THEN the system SHALL record a validation failure for missing image
5. WHEN both required properties are present THEN the system SHALL record a validation success

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see clear validation results, so that I can quickly understand whether my devcontainer.json file is valid or not.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display a success message to standard output
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL display a failure message to standard output
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL exit with a non-zero exit code
4. WHEN validation succeeds THEN the system SHALL exit with exit code 0

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed error messages when validation fails, so that I can understand exactly what needs to be fixed in my devcontainer.json file.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the "name" property is missing THEN the system SHALL display an error message specifying that the "name" property is required
2. WHEN the "image" property is missing THEN the system SHALL display an error message specifying that the "image" property is required
3. WHEN multiple validation rules are violated THEN the system SHALL display all relevant error messages
4. WHEN displaying error messages THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which specific rules were violated
